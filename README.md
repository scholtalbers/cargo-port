This project addresses the problem of unreliable URLs by providing stable, long term storage for downloads.
Instead of hoping that the upstream author (e.g. sourceforge or CPAN) will not remove or modify a downloadable
.tar.gz file over time, you can rely on the Galaxy Cargo Port to maintain a copy of that
file long term.

This helps package authors and tool developers work more efficiently, by
allowing them to rely on URLs being permanently available.

## Contributing

Please make pull requests (PRs) adding new lines to the `urls.tsv` file with your package, the
expected sha256sum, and optionally a comment. If you don't need to make
sweeping changes to `urls.tsv` the quickest choice for editing it is the 
github online editor. Just ensure you change the **indent mode** to tabs. 
Alternatively, using a spreadsheet tool like libreoffice will work best
locally and for vizualising column alignments. 
If you do need to edit it in vim, `:set ts=120` will be helpful in aligning columns.

## URL file

The file consists of eight tab separated columns:

Column | Name          | Meaning
------ | ------------- | --------
1      | Id            | A package ID, some short, unique (in the file) identifier for the package.
2      | Version       | A version number for the package. Should represent upstream's version accurately.
3      | Platform      | One of (linux, windows, darwin, src)
4      | Architecture  | One of (x32, x64, all)
5      | Upstream URL  | Upstream's URL for the download. This only necessarily exist before the Community Package Cacher downloads is the first time. After that the URL may disappear and we will retain our copy
6      | Extension     | File extension, used in downloads/nicer access for end-users
7      | sha256sum     | sha256sum of the correct file.
8      | Use upstream  | A boolean True or False on whether we should request upstream first, or use depot's download. Useful if upstream has requested that we stop making so many downloads to their old releases, or if the upstream URL is no longer available.

## Using TCP

You can use cargo-port with a small script called `galaxy-package-locator`.
Argument `--package_id` specifies the package name, `--package_version` the package version and with `--download_location` you can provide a path where the tarball should be stored.

Cargo port can be installed as follows:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/cargo-port.git
$ cd cargo-port
$ python setup.py build
$ sudo python setup.py install
```

Downloading a package with galaxy-package-locator can be done as follows:

```
galaxy-package-locator --package_id samtools --package_version "1.2"
```

## Mirroring the Cargo Port

The cargo port is available via rsync from [rsync://depot.galaxyproject.org/software](rsync://depot.galaxyproject.org/software
)

Here are some available mirrors for the cargoport:

- https://cpt.tamu.edu/cargoport/ [![Build Status](https://cpt.tamu.edu/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=cargoport-backup)](https://cpt.tamu.edu/jenkins/job/cargoport-backup/)

If you are willing to mirror the cargo port, please go ahead and do so, and pull request this file with your URL.
